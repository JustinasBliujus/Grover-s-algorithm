# Grover's Algorithm in Qiskit (2-Qubit Target Amplification)

- This project implements **Grover's search algorithm** on a **2-qubit quantum system** using **Qiskit Runtime (SamplerV2)**. 
- This was part of the coursework in Fundamentals of Quantum Computing

## Objective

Design and execute a quantum circuit using Qiskit that:
- Uses **Grover’s algorithm** to amplify a marked state (`|11⟩`) among 4 possibilities.
- Implements both the **oracle** and **diffuser** (reflection operator).
- Uses the **IBM Quantum Runtime** for optimized and accelerated simulation or hardware execution.
